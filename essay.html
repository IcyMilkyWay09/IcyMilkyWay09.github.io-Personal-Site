    <p class="essay">
        The BADAS program at the University of Florida interests me not because of the name,
        but because of what I could learn through the experiences throughout the track, and
        the community I could build that goes well beyond the classroom. Learning how to
        create video games through this program has been a dream of mine since I played my
        first game. 
    </p>
    <p class="essay">
        I have always been able to find a home in video games, no matter where I live. I moved
        to Florida from Nevada in the middle of high school, and lost many connections during
        that change. Video games were a stress-free place I could reside in when I needed familiarity,
        which is something I hope to create for people that need it most. I have also gained a stronger
        outlook on life through playing video games; storylines in video games can change your understanding
        of something you might have considered immovable. I hope to create something similarly life changing
        during my time in this program, and perhaps something that lasts long after. 
    </p>
    <p class="essay">
        I have a passion for many things, but my love for writing and coding have always been strongest. 
        When I realized I could combine the two through video game development, I have never looked back. 
        To build the skills necessary for this career track, I used my time in school to take seven computer 
        science classes on a college level, one digital art class, four physical art classes that utilized 
        digital resources, two creative writing classes, and many other courses that prioritized creativity. 
        Throughout these classes, I won an academic award for my digital art skills, and another local award 
        for a few creative writing pieces. Outside of the classroom, I owned a personal web development business, 
        IcyScript, at fifteen years old, with all proper documents. While building this business, I worked with a 
        construction company to create a website that showcased their work on a professional platform. After working 
        with this company, I used my development skills to build an online presence for my Etsy shop, CandiExpress. 
        I perform the production, marketing and web presence myself with help from the computer science courses I am 
        taking at Santa Fe College.

    <p class="essay">
        BADAS will help me gain professional experience in what the digital workplace is today, and what it might
        become as I work in the industry. It will take what I know from my experiences in web development and push
        them toward game development. These classes will let me better understand the very real deadlines and
        expectations in the field, as well as necessary peer criticism as I work my way through the courses. Learning
        methods of video game design from professionals will only enhance these incredibly important points for myself
        and my peers, who I hope to grow with throughout this track. Building a community is one of the most important
        things for me, and I hope to grow my own bubble at this college, and create another for those online that are
        missing their own.
